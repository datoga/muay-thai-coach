# Audio Assets

This directory contains audio files for the music feature.

## Expected Files

- `beat1.mp3` - Royalty-free training loop 1
- `beat2.mp3` - Royalty-free training loop 2

## Getting Audio Files

For production, add royalty-free audio loops. Recommended sources:

1. [Free Music Archive](https://freemusicarchive.org/)
2. [YouTube Audio Library](https://studio.youtube.com/channel/audio)
3. [Pixabay Music](https://pixabay.com/music/)

Make sure any audio you use is:
- Royalty-free or properly licensed
- Loopable (for seamless repeat)
- Appropriate tempo for training (100-140 BPM recommended)

## Placeholder

For development, the app will gracefully handle missing audio files.
The metronome feature uses Web Audio API and doesn't require any files.
